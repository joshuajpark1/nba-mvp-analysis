# NBA MVP Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes NBA player stats to identify potential MVP candidates using historical trends.

## Dataset

The analysis uses publicly available NBA player statistics data. Below are the sources used in this project:

## Process
1. Data Cleaning: Handled missing data, filtered relevant seasons, and standardized columns.
2. Exploratory Analysis: Visualized trends between stats and MVP wins.
3. Prediction: Used a scoring formula to rank players based on their performance.

## Tools
- **R**: Data cleaning and visualization (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`)
- **SQL**: Database queries and analysis.
- **Tableau**: Visual dashboards.

## Results
- Top 5 MVP candidates (2023 Season):
  1. Player A
  2. Player B
  3. ...
  
## Future Work
- Automate real-time data analysis using APIs.
- Implement machine learning models for MVP predictions.
